# Automating-Working-Env

### It is a python script to automate my workstation with a clicks of buttons.
### Features
The widget does the following work while 
- Open my **Github** profile in Firefox
- Opens my **project folder** containing list of all my projects 
- Autologin to **Cet-Wifi** *(My College Wifi)*
- Opens Songs in **Saavn** *(P.S. I love music)*

All the dependencies are stored inside requirements.txt folder, so after cloning the repository do
``` pip install -r requirements.txt ```

The widget is made to appear everytime the system opens by creating a symlink.
##### Suggestions are always welcomed to improve it.
##### So do open an issue for it.

- Made with Love :)
